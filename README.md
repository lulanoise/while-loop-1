# Exercise: While Loop 1
* print on screen infinite times `I am in loop` every 1 second
  * use `sleep()` method from `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit` to *count* 1 second
  * place the `sleep()` method inside this statement: `try { /* place here sleep() */ } catch (InterruptedException e) { }`
* stop the execution (from command line you can use `CTRL + C`, from `IntelliJ IDEA` you can press the red square button)
